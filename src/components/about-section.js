        <h2>Hello, My name is Aaron Schuyler.</h2>
        <p>I am a combination of self-taught and boot camp taught in several languages and technologies including VueJS, React, JavaScript, TypeScript, NodeJS, Ruby, Rails, and some AWS for good measure. My background is in digital marketing, though I have developed a real passion for technology over the past 5 or so years. I learned HTML and CSS in High School and played around with coding ever since. I started freelancing in web development in 2018, teaching myself along the way. I learned Javascript, PHP, Server administration, DNS, HTTP protocols. All the good stuff!</p><p>After a couple of years of freelancing, I decided to hone in on my software engineering skills and applied for Flatiron School. In boot camp, I was able to solidify my knowledge of programming principles and learned Ruby and React to add to my list of skills. I have also taught myself NodeJS and VueJS over the span of a year, and have fallen in love with the MEVN/MERN tech stack. </p><p>I am passionate, motivated, and hungry to learn. I adapt well to new environments, make friends easily, and learn extremely fast. These abilities, combined with my professional experience and skills, poise me for anything that comes my way.</p>
